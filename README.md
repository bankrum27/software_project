Need to have the live server extension installed on Visual Studio Code.

How to run:
1. Open node.js
2. Take files to whichever IDE you want to use (we used Visual Studio Code)
3. Open the terminal, and type 'npm install', this will install all the modules you'll need to run
4. Type 'node server.js'
5. Open the program by right clicking login.html and click "Open with Live Server"
